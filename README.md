<h1>Lapa Arches</h1>

## Description

The project was designed to spread information about an important monument of Brazil that usually is not very considered by tourists, an architectural structure that had indeed a great importance for my country during its history.  The historical information is given in a simple and clear way on the main menu of the site. A gallery of pictures is included as well, together with a contact form, available to ask for information about the monument.

## Theme

The theme chosen for the project was architecture, historical and monumental art.
The aim of this website is to capture the interest of potential visitors of the structure in a straightforward and simple way.
I chose to use colours that are not too heavy for the eyes and they are the following:
#C6AC80 Ecr√∫
#3B4154 Charcoal ( variations)
#08090C Black.
