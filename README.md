<h1>Lapa Arches</h1>

## Description

The project was designed to spread information about an important monument of Brazil that usually is not very considered by tourists, an architectural structure that had indeed a great importance for my country during its history.  The historical information is given in a simple and clear way on the main menu of the site. A gallery of pictures is included as well, together with a contact form, available to ask for information about the monument.

## Project Goals

- Primary goal should be to accurately and passionately present the history and significance of the Lapa Arches. Provide in-depth information about the origin, construction, architectural features, and historical events associated with the arches. Use a combination of text and images interactive elements to engage visitors and transport them back in time.

- As a historic site, promote responsible tourism by providing information on ethical and respectful ways to visit the Lapa Arches. Include guidelines for behavior, respect for historical sites, and sustainable tourism practices.


## Theme

The theme chosen for the project was architecture, historical and monumental art.
The aim of this website is to capture the interest of potential visitors of the structure in a straightforward and simple way.
I chose to use colours that are not too heavy for the eyes and they are the following:
- White
- #fffffff  White.
- #08090C Black.

##  User Expericence (UX)

Entering the site, the user can see a menu that contains the options “home”, “history” and “gallery”.
Without needing to scroll, clicking on of the options will take them directly to the portion of the page wanted. 
This app is easy to navigate and it shows clearly the topic, at the bottom of the page the user can find also the social media icons, a “visit us” option, a map and the “home” button.

## Users Expectations
- As a user, I expect to find a site that is easy to navigate and intuitive.
- As a user, I expect the site to show me the history of the monument in a simple and short way without being boring.
