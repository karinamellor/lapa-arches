                                        <p>The Carioca Aqueduct (Portuguese: Aqueduto da Carioca), also known as Arcos da Lapa, is an aqueduct in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
                                        The aqueduct was built in the middle of the 18th century to bring fresh water from the Carioca River to the population of the city.
                                        It is a typical example of colonial architecture and engineeri
                                        The Carioca Aqueduct is located in the centre of the city, in the Lapa neighbourhood.<br>
                                        Since the end of the 19th century the aqueduct serves as a bridge for the Santa Teresa Tramway that connects the city centre with the Santa Teresa neighbourhood uphill.</p>
                                        <br><p> in Lapa began to be planned as early as 1600, in fact its construction began in the eighteenth century, 
                                         between the years 1723 and 1744, 
                                         and one of the main reasons for its construction was because at that 
                                         time the population of Rio de Janeiro suffered from lack of water.<br>
                                         So the idea was to take water from the Rio Carioca to a fountain in Largo da Carioca.<br>
                                         From there, the water was distributed to another fountain in Place XV, where ships arrived.<br> 
                                         The aqueduct was built between the hills of Santa Teresa and Santo Ant√¥nio, of which little remains, 
                                         since part had been destroed in the 1950s.</p><br>

                                          <p>Arches extend for approximately 270 meters and the height reaches a little less than 18 meters.<br>
                                          Composed of 42 Roman-style arches,<br> the Arcos da Lapa is the largest and most important colonial 
                                          building in Brazil (and Rio de Janeiro)
                                          Like most of the buildings of the time, they were also built by indigenous and African slaves.</p>
                                          <p>The aqueduct was deactivated at the end of the 19th century, as new alternatives to supply water to Rio were developed. The structure was adapted in 1896 to serve as a viaduct for a tram line the Bonde de Santa Teresa (Santa Teresa Tramway) 
                                          that transports passengers between the centre of Rio and the hilly Santa Teresa neighbourhood. 
                                          The picturesque ride is popular among locals and tourists alike. The Santa Teresa bonde (or bondinho, meaning "little tram") is the only tram still in operation in Rio de Janeiro, 
                                          although the 2016-opened Rio de Janeiro Light Rail system is similar to a tramway on some sections</p>
