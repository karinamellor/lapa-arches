                    <h1>Lapa</h1>

                     <p>Lapa Arches in Lapa began to be planned as early as 1600, in fact its construction began in the eighteenth century, between the years 1723 and 1744,<br> 
                    and one of the main reasons for its construction was because at that time the population of Rio de Janeiro suffered from lack of water.<br>
                    So the idea was to take water from the Rio Carioca to a fountain in Largo da Carioca.<br>
                     From there, the water was distributed to another fountain in Place XV, where ships arrived.<br> 
                  </div> The aqueduct was built between the hills of Santa Teresa and Santo Ant√¥nio, of which little remains, since part had been destroyexd in the 1950s.</p>

                   <h1>Facts about Arches in Lapa</h1>
                   The arches extend for approximately 270 meters and the height reaches a little less than 18 meters.<br>
                   Composed of 42 Roman-style arches, the Arcos da Lapa is the largest and most important colonial building in Brazil (and Rio de Janeiro)!<br> 
                    Like most of the buildings of the time, they were also built by indigenous and African slaves.
