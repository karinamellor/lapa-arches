                <h1>Lapa</h1><br>
               <p>The Arches in Lapa began to be planned as early as 1600, in fact its construction began in the eighteenth century, between the years 1723 and 1744, and one of the main reasons for its construction was because at that time the population of Rio de Janeiro suffered from lack of water.<br>
                   So the idea was to take water from the Rio Carioca to a fountain in Largo da Carioca.<br>
                   From there, the water was distributed to another fountain in Place XV, where ships arrived.<br> The aqueduct was built between the hills of Santa Teresa and Santo Ant√¥nio, of which little remains, since part had been destroyexd in the 1950s. </p>
